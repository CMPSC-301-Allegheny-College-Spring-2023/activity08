## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:
